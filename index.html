        <p>Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to create.
            So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

    <p>When creating a website, it is crucial to have a unified style throughout the page. Any inconsistencies, such as using fonts or sizes that are not exact, can be very distracting to readers. However, if web developers were forced to go through each element within every page to make sure everything was in the correct form, it would be a giant pain.
        Thankfully, developers can avoid this tedious task by implementing CSS selectors. There are five categories of selectors, but this article focuses on simple selectors: ID and class selectors.
        When working in CSS, IDs and classes can identify and block elements together to ensure they share design elements. Properly used, IDs and classes can make code cleaner and easier to structure. They can be tricky to figure out at first, but once you get the hang of using these signifiers, they can simplify and speed up the coding process.
        What Is ID?
        An ID allows developers to identify a single element in the HTML code and apply a particular style to it. IDs are specific and targeted, similar to a proper noun. There can be multiple elements on a page, but the ID marks a specific element. Each element can only have one ID, and each page can only have one element with that specific ID.
